                This site is a starting place for my career, a launch site you may say. This is fairly new to me and I want to do the best I can. My brother went through this program and he said it was hard work. To be honest I'm scared.
                I'm scared of failing, scared of giving up, but scared for all those that have helped me to get here. I want to do the best
                I can but I can't do it on my own. With the help of the amazing instructors, the students around me, and my own family, I'll be able to accomplish anything I put my mind to.

                Work, school, work, school, and work, and school. Off and on I have been working hard through these days. 
                I've been going through all the pre-work and still working full time and trying to find times for my hobbies.
                HTML and CSS were fairly easy to pick up. Had lots of fun with the assignments and even struggled some but nothing I couldn't finish that night.
                The ability to take words and characters and to form a page of code that makes a beautiful website is amazing in my eyes. I was talking with one of my friends about my school and they said they could never do it. I explained to them it's just like their drawings. They have an idea
                in their minds for a sketch then they start with a blank sheet of paper and after hours and hours of work, they have their final sketch.
                It's the same thing with code, taking your ideas and dreams and being able to make those come true is breathtaking.

                JavaScript o JavaScprit why do you have to be so stubborn! I kid you not, I use to play video games and be up in the late PM. I since stopped because I always got frustrated and wanted to break my mouse or keyboard. I have since moved on and found better hobbies to make me a better person.
                I thought all that rage and anger were in the past but little did I know that JavaScprit is just as frustrating. I read these lessons and assignments and sit there thinking that I must be the dumbest person alive because I have not idea what they're saying or what they're asking of me to do. One night I was stuck so bad
                That I was so close to putting a dent in my desk. I have since sought help from friends, family. and even strangers on Reddit for help. I'm a proud man who doesn't want to ask for help but my brother wasn't kidding when he said this was hard. I sure hope my friend JavaScprit can get a little nicer to me! :/
